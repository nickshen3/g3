//! Tool Result Poisoning Test
//!
//! This test reproduces the bug where partial JSON tool call patterns in tool results
//! (e.g., from reading a source file with comments containing tool call examples)
//! incorrectly trigger the parser's incomplete tool call detection.
//!
//! The key insight: tool results should NEVER be searched for JSON tool calls.
//! Only the LLM's actual response text should be parsed for tool calls.
