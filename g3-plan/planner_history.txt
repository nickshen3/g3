  Planner mode refinements for g3-planner: display first 25 lines of coach feedback (not just char count), ensure TODO
  file writes to g3-plan dir and prevent deletion during planning (needed for history rename), write GIT COMMIT history
  entry before actual commit for better audit trail, use single-line UI updates with carriage return during LLM processing
  (show thinking/tool count/context size) while still printing agent text responses, and redirect all logs to workspace...

<<
  Planner mode UI has excessive whitespace in tool call output despite previous fixes. Tool calls must display on single
  lines with first 50 chars of args, using safe character boundary truncation. LLM text responses appear mangled and need
  proper flushing without newline handling issues. Logs still write to wrong directory instead of workspace/logs despite
  G3_WORKSPACE_PATH being set. All fixes must be verified by actually running the app and observing terminal output and
  file locations on disk.

  Fourth attempt to fix planner UI issues: excessive whitespace between tool calls and logs written to wrong
  directory. Must run app with --planning flag, verify tool calls display on single lines with no blank lines between
  them, and confirm all logs (errors, sessions, tool_calls, context_window) write to <workspace>/logs not codepath.
  Previous attempts failed due to lack of actual testing. Implementer must visually verify fixes work before submitting.

<<
  Ensure g3-planner always writes `GIT COMMIT (<MESSAGE>)` to planner_history.txt before any git commit.  
  The history entry must remain even if git commit fails, and the summary must match the commit message.  
  Use git history to find when write_git_commit was moved after git::commit, and when it was fixed again.  
  Record SHAs, messages, and a short explanation of why the regression happened in an external note.  
  Add code comments, a unit test, and documentation to guard against reintroducing the wrong ordering.
