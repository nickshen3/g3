# g3 Configuration Example - Coach/Player Mode
#
# This configuration demonstrates using different providers for coach and player
# roles in autonomous mode. The coach reviews code while the player implements.

[providers]
# Default provider used when no specific provider is specified
default_provider = "anthropic.default"

# Coach uses a model optimized for code review and analysis
coach = "anthropic.coach"

# Player uses a model optimized for code generation
player = "anthropic.player"

# Optional: Use a specialized model for planning mode
# planner = "anthropic.planner"

# Default Anthropic configuration
[providers.anthropic.default]
api_key = "your-anthropic-api-key"
model = "claude-sonnet-4-5"
max_tokens = 64000
temperature = 0.2

# Coach configuration - focused on careful analysis
[providers.anthropic.coach]
api_key = "your-anthropic-api-key"
model = "claude-sonnet-4-5"
max_tokens = 32000
temperature = 0.1  # Lower temperature for more consistent reviews

# Player configuration - focused on code generation
[providers.anthropic.player]
api_key = "your-anthropic-api-key"
model = "claude-sonnet-4-5"
max_tokens = 64000
temperature = 0.3  # Slightly higher for more creative implementations

# Optional: Planner configuration with extended thinking
# [providers.anthropic.planner]
# api_key = "your-anthropic-api-key"
# model = "claude-opus-4-5"
# max_tokens = 64000
# thinking_budget_tokens = 16000  # Enable extended thinking for planning

# Example: Using Databricks for one of the roles
# [providers.databricks.default]
# host = "https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com"
# model = "databricks-claude-sonnet-4"
# max_tokens = 4096
# temperature = 0.1
